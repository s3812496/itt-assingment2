        <h1>Classy for Kids</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Our idea is for an interactive server based virtual classroom called Classy for Kids where the target
            audience is from Prep to grade 6. This software enables teachers to monitor and give work to their class,
            the teachers will be able to; view the students webcam and desktop in the virtual instance, launch programs
            and open files in the virtual instance, restrict program use to a selected program, take control of the
            virtual instance, and transfer files to and from the virtual instance. All without having access to the host
            machine the students are using to connect to the service. When the session is opened the teachers can choose
            to start a web call with the class when the student's login. A desktop app and web client will be available.
