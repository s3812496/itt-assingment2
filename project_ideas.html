        <h1>Classy for Kids</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Our idea is for an interactive server based virtual classroom called Classy for Kids where the target
            audience is from Prep to grade 6. This software enables teachers to monitor and give work to their class,
            the teachers will be able to; view the students webcam and desktop in the virtual instance, launch programs
            and open files in the virtual instance, restrict program use to a selected program, take control of the
            virtual instance, and transfer files to and from the virtual instance. All without having access to the host
            machine the students are using to connect to the service. When the session is opened the teachers can choose
            to start a web call with the class when the student's login. A desktop app and web client will be available.
        </p>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            In a world full of educational uncertainty, give your staff and students peace of mind with Classy. Classy
            is a complete virtual classroom that gives both teachers and students the freedom to conduct everyday
            classroom activities in a virtual environment. Our team here at classy believe that online learning
            shouldn't be a simple video feed between teachers and students but rather an interactive experience that
            engages young minds. We have utilized leading cloud virtual machine technology to provide a seamless
            classroom experience to every home. Features such as remote application launching, and automatic classroom
            video calling give teachers the ability to remotely assign their students with virtual worksheets as well as
            the ability to discuss them as a class through video calling functionality. Online learning doesn't have to
            be era's behind physical learning, help to bridge that gap with Classy!
        </p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Classy for kids is a cloud based virtual classroom that is built using virtual machines and an interface
            that can execute commands and take control of those virtual machines. The virtual machines will come
            pre-installed with Microsoft teams and be pre logged in ready to automatically join a session with the
            teacher. When a student logs in to a session. The teacher's user interface will be able to execute commands
            to open programs, open files, and give remote access control to the teacher. The virtual machine will be
            locked down in a way that stops students from opening other programs other than what the teacher has
            assigned to open. File storage will be networked mapped to the virtual machines and will be hosted on a
            cloud storage service hosted by Classy, no root access will be provided to the client pc's connecting to
            Classys services.
        </p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
            Classy for kids will be able to replace or acts as an additional classroom for schools and teachers which
            will be easier for institutions that may not have as many resources for things like building additional
            classrooms or kids that are stuck at home or are overseas being able to learn like as if it was a virtual
            classroom and not worry about the service being complicated as it will be easy to use and will feature a lot
            of security feature that will make teachers confident. This will solve the original problem of students
            feeling like they are not in a classroom as it will try to emulate a classroom as best as it can and the
            impact will be that during a crisis or pandemic it will easier for students to access resources and teachers
            set up virtual classroom which can effectively teach a student with their work and deploy it as quickly as
            possible.
