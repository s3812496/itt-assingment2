    <h1>Having looked at your updated Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h1>

    <p>While we could not use the 2020 burning glass data inferring from the March 2018 Data it was shown that Solutions architect 
    became number one replacing developer programmer, as well as others taking different places of jobs in 2017. Ahnaf Zaman's ideal job 
    was database admin but wasn’t included in the new data which hasn’t really had much of effect of his opinion on his ideal job as he finds it 
    still appealing and makes him feel more competitive on database admin jobs. Nathans's ideal job Systems engineer was less in demand compared to 
    2017 but he was still confident as there was still a high demand for the job and still feels as it is his ideal job.  Joshes ideal job of a software 
    developer was significantly less in demand compared to 2017 which had him questioning if it will still to be his ideal job or he has to find something more 
    in demand but he sees software developer as still his ideal job as it is something that he is passionate about.  Cybersecurity analyst was an ideal job for Julian 
    but was not featured in the new data but has not changed Julian’s mind as it is something, he is familiar with and interested in. Likewise, James wants to work as an 
    ICT security specialist but that was not featured 
    in the new data which does not worry James as he sees there will always be a market for security.</p>
