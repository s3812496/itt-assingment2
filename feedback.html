            Nathan has overall performed really well. He contributed to doing his part of the team profile, he set up
            the GitHub repository and set up the website using AWS. He also interviewed an IT professional and wrote and
            summarized the answers given. Lastly, he also came up with the idea of the project idea and wrote about it
            as well as doing the group reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ahnaf has overall performed really well. He did the industry data and answered all the questions required,
            he did one of the IT technologies which consisted of a 1500 word report, did his part in the team profile,
            wrote some of the project idea and did his group reflection. He also did work on GitHub and the website as
            well.
        </p>

            James has overall performed really well. He did his part to the team profile, worked on GitHub, did a 1500

            Stardust crusaders was able to pull through even though the past couple of weeks had been tough and everyone
            had worked hard on the assignment. Our I.T lead Nathan did a great job of setting up the technical aspects
            of the website and contributed a lot, but some criticism could be that at the start of the assignment he
            wasn’t leading much but overall he was clear in his goals and during the latter half of our time of the
            assignment he pulled through. Julian contributed a lot of things to the assignment in terms of content and
            he was able to consistently finish work that needed to be done on time, and the only criticism to him would
            be that his time management skills could have been better but that improved as the group became more
            familiar with each other. James helped organize the group and steer the group in the right direction and
            contributed a lot to a lot and the only negative aspect would be that he could have worked on the html and
            CSS more. Josh brings a lot of passion to his work which help make the contents of our assignment 2 richer
            and it shows, but a thing he could work on is finishing his aspect of the work on time.

            Nathan performed incredibly well in this assignment as our technical lead. His consistent hard-working
            attitude and application towards the assignment made him an incredibly valuable team member to work
            alongside and I was especially impressed by his previous knowledge in Git and CSS. Nathan also actively went
            out of his way to help explain the more technical concepts of the assignment to team members making the
            whole process a lot easier to follow along with. Ahnaf did a great job at organizing meetings and checking
            in on the group regularly. His leadership in the group communication field proved to be incredibly helpful
            and his consistent enthusiastic attitude helped to motivate group members to be better. Julian was an
            integral part of the team who consistently met deadlines with ease and often went above and beyond with his
            reports and tasks. Julian proved to be a hardworking and friendly member of the team from the very start and
            was always keen to add his own input and ideas to projects when needed. Josh helped in the writing up of IT
            Technology and punctually attended all meetings. Josh proved that he was able to output work to a high
            standard in these sections and he was a great team player.
