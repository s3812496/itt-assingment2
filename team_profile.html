        <h2>James Henderson</h2>
        <p>
            Hey! My name is James Henderson and I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT university.
            My family history consists of 1800s English/Irish settlers migrating to
            Byron Bay and settling in Ballarat during the gold rush. I speak a mix of English and Auslan (Australian
            sign language) at home with the primary language being English. I graduated
            high school last year at CBC St Kilda where I chose Legal Studies, Computing - Informatics, Further
            Mathematics, Psychology, English and CISCO Networking as my year 12 subjects.
            I am quite passionate about water sports and I regularly partake in hobbies such as swimming, surfing and
            lifesaving. I used to play hockey, AFL and chess for my high school’s teams and eventually
            became an accredited U13s football coach. I have also recently joined the RMIT surfing and ultimate frisbee
            clubs.

            Hello, my name is Joshua Kreppold! (student 3838911) I am from the eastern suburbs Melbourne Australia and
            am studying a Bachelor of Information technology at RMIT.
            I completed year 12 in 2019 at Yarra Hills secondary collage where I’ve had some IT experience coding. We
            worked with php7 and the problem-solving methodology in the IT Software development class.
            Programming interests me because of its creative potential, but I am also taken in by User centered design
            because of the process of making something usable for other people.
            In my spare time I enjoy playing in the Vrl rugby competition with the boys from the Eastern Raptors, and I
            also enjoy playing video games when I can.
