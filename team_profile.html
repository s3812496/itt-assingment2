        <h2>James Henderson</h2>
        <p>
            Hey! My name is James Henderson and I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT university.
            My family history consists of 1800s English/Irish settlers migrating to
            Byron Bay and settling in Ballarat during the gold rush. I speak a mix of English and Auslan (Australian
            sign language) at home with the primary language being English. I graduated
            high school last year at CBC St Kilda where I chose Legal Studies, Computing - Informatics, Further
            Mathematics, Psychology, English and CISCO Networking as my year 12 subjects.
            I am quite passionate about water sports and I regularly partake in hobbies such as swimming, surfing and
            lifesaving. I used to play hockey, AFL and chess for my high school's teams and eventually
            became an accredited U13s football coach. I have also recently joined the RMIT surfing and ultimate frisbee
            clubs.

        <h2>Joshua Kreppold</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Joshua Kreppold! (student 3838911) I am from the eastern suburbs Melbourne Australia and
            am studying a Bachelor of Information technology at RMIT.
            I completed year 12 in 2019 at Yarra Hills secondary collage where I've had some IT experience coding. We
            worked with php7 and the problem-solving methodology in the IT Software development class.
            Programming interests me because of its creative potential, but I am also taken in by User centered design
            because of the process of making something usable for other people.
            In my spare time I enjoy playing in the Vrl rugby competition with the boys from the Eastern Raptors, and I
            also enjoy playing video games when I can.

            The ideal jobs for the individual members is as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Nathan: Systems Engineer</li>
                <li>Ahnaf: Database Admin</li>
                <li>James: Cyber Security Analyst</li>
                <li>Joshua: Software Dev</li>
                <li>Julian: Cyber Security Analyst</li>
            </ul>
            James and Julian have a IT Security role as their Ideal Job, while Nathan and Ahnaf have Systems
            Engineer and Database Admin respectively. Joshua has Software Dev<br><br>

            Database Admin Differs from an IT security role in that a Database admin may plan, instal, configure and
            monitor performance and upkeep of databases, where IT Security looks for vulnerabilities in all types of IT
            systems and solutions and implements patches and fixes to rectify any issues that arise based on id
            security<br><br>

            Systems Engineer and Software Dev are the closest as they are both related to creating and deploying
            solutions in to the public under the direction of a company

            I believe that I would be quite valuable to the group because I am good at taking others opinions and trying
            to reach a middle ground of implementing multiple ideas to make everyone's input valid and ultimately
            building a better solution because of that. Although my test says Introverted i think of myself as a person
            that will put myself out there to better the groups results.

        <p>
            In the process of initiating new ideas or projects I might have a better idea of processes or concepts if
            presented visually such as a chart, slides or pictures explain what the group might

            want to do with the project and how to proceed. When examining other I tend to write down suggestion that
            might be useful or I see as interesting and might examine those ideas on my spare time. When having trouble,
            I am most likely to do a face to face meeting and communicate via asking questions to other group members
            and overall tend to steer towards visual style of learning.

        <h3>Summary of Results</h3>
        <p>
            I think it is quite important to know the test outcomes of each group member and use that to an advantage
            when pitching ideas or explaining concepts to different group members. As a hands on learner myself I
            believe I would benefit heavily from adapting my methods of explaining things to a more auditory or visual
            setting to suit the needs of my group. This deeper understanding of my group would allow me to more
            thoroughly plan ideas out as I must develop them for different mediums (e.g. an auditory pitch or a visual
            graph). After also having a better understanding on what sort of Myer Briggs personality types compliment
            mine, I know that more logical minded people tend to work quite well in a group with me as it allows for my
            more creative and idea focused mindset to be interpreted practically and encourages the challenging of my
            ideas to create a better product.

        <p>
            Overall, I feel that the results from all three online tests do line up to match my characteristics. I would
            usually describe myself as hands on and a logical thinker, the results from all three tests support this.
            Within a group setting I feel knowing this information could be helpful because it means tasks may better be
            allocated to those with the right strengths for the role. I also believe that knowing each other’s strengths
            helps us get to know each other better, and that in turn means we can work more efficiently together.

        <h3>Summary of Results</h3>
        <p>
            Based off my results from these tests my behavior in a team could be different to other people. As an
            introvert I am more likely to shy away from group tasks or big group tasks, maybe opting to work with only 2
            or 3 other people. My behavior may show that when making decisions I will primarily base them off facts
            rather than personal concerns. Results based off the learning style test suggest I am more of a visual
            learner than anything else suggesting that I will learn best when information is presented in a written
            language format or in another visual format such as pictures or diagrams. The big five personality test
            suggests that I am organized which will help in groups and that I am determined to reach a goal. It also
            suggests that I experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get satisfaction out of serving and taking
            care of others and am trusting and forgiving which means I am able to work with people very easily and they
            can work with me fairly easily with little social complication arising.
