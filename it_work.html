            <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?:</h3> <br>

            I deal with all sorts of people, from general staff all the way up to CEOâ€™s, I also interact with other I.T professionals who may work for other industries to collaborate on certain issues. <br><br>

            <h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?:</h3> <br>

            I spend most of my time at client sites sorting out any issues they may have.<br><br>

            <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?:</h3> <br>

            I.T is a forever changing environment and with that I think the most challenging aspect is trying to keep up with all of the changes that are constantly happening in the space.
