    <h2>Machnine learning By Ahnaf Zaman</h2>
    <p>Machine learning Is seen as a branch of artificial intelligence and works by learning from experience without being programmed to do so using various algorithms. Currently the state of the art in machine learning is according to medium, transfer learning which allows algorithms used for a task, be used for a different task such as an algorithm used for identifying the colour yellow now used to look for yellows cars. Another state-of-the-art technology used for machine learning is a voice user interface, which is by personal assistants such as Siri Alexa and works by “deep learning algorithms” like speech recognition and language modelling. Another technology used by machine learning is “artificial neural networks”. Neural networks attempt to simulate how the human brain functions by having an input layer, hidden layer and an output layer where it is connected by edges and is used for many purposes such as sakes forecasting to more morally grey areas such as deep fakes which the likeness of someone is replaced by another. Currently with machine learning a lot can be done and the more positives things are as mentioned are voice assistants which are improving daily as the algorithm learns how to interacts with a human and allows user to set up times, search up information or play music and much more using voice, and googles new project duplex highlights how advanced this technology can be as the app allows the assistant to make a reservation in shops with the voice assistant without needing to do a lot of interacting with the phone operator at all, with the assistant using a natural sounding voice. Another use of machine learning that may be controversial to a lot is mass surveillance and detection. Using facial recognition algorithms, it can detect faces and identify a person for various things, most common is criminals and the algorithm has a low error rate which is becoming lower each year as governments and companies utilizes it more and more. The technology is notoriously used in “personalization” for marketing which uses the system to flood users with ads relating to something the user saw online and shows up across various websites with ads that a user might go to. Relating to personalisation various sites also use to cater to a user’s taste such as Netflix which might give a user similar results to a movie or tv show that they watched appearing in a recommended tab. In the future machine learning algorithms will become much more advanced allowing more innovations such as applications in voice assistant as the assistant will be able to understand more speech patterns and have a wider range of applications a user can talk about.
         The neural network will also allow things such as pattern recognition get more accurate as it gets more utilized allowing computers to do things like creating an image from just a suggestion from the user and will also let companies can use it for more accurate targeted ads or making games run much smoother such as NVidia DLSS using A.I to upscale things and the technology will be much more utilized and more accurate in the next 3 years. This is possible due to technology becoming much more powerful such as the CPU getting more cores and semiconductor manufacturing becoming more efficient and smaller allowing machine learning to do repetitions. And advancements in network technology such as 4g and 5g allows machine learning to help self-driving cars drive more accurately track its location and send data back to the company faster and track the location of the care more accurately. In the future quantum computing is said to accelerate the process of machine learning and greatly improve other areas it is used in such as realistic A.I. The impact of machine learning is great as it is being currently used everywhere on the internet and in many industries such as healthcare, finance, and the government. Things that are likely to change are the automation industry which will employ self-driving cars in the future that will allow customers to travel from one location to another or customer service with companies using more digital assistants to interact with users than humans. Education could also change such as virtual tutors helping children with tasks reducing workloads on teachers. According to Forbes the Global market could grow to an estimated $126 billion in 2024. The top industry for machine learning is chatbots followed by process optimization than fraud analysis. For machine learning there are currently over 98000 open positions for machine learning worldwide. The people that are most likely to be affected is everyone, as it will be utilized in more and more applications as machine learning is flexible and makes many industries that require repetition suitable for machine learning, and is also used in social media for facial recognition and search engine optimization, and will be used for self-driving cars in the future that the general population would use. As machine learning becomes more advanced a lot of jobs might be lost such as taxi driving and a lot of retail jobs and according to Forbes it could make take away an estimated 75 million jobs worldwide but Forbes while fortune state that 40% of the world jobs will be lost with truck drivers and retail being most affected. It is also reported by Forbes that A.I and machine 
         learning will create more jobs with a potential of 133 million new jobs worldwide by 2022. This is affecting you right now in your daily life as almost every major site uses some form of the machine learning algorithm, such as YouTube when watching a video will cater to your taste depending on what type of video you watch,
          and many sites will personalize ads tailored to you. If you use a voice assistant, it is getting millions of inputs that it's using to give a more accurate response to make the experience more lifelike and if you play video games, machine learning is being utilized to upscale the resolution of games and make the A.i of the game much smarter and more lifelike. Machine learning applications
         can be different for each user if they choose to use more applications that utilize machine learning such as a personal assistant or extensive use of social media which will use machine learning to tailor to you such as giving you ads that might be different or Netflix giving you a unique selection of shows based on what you just watched. This will affect the people around you as well such as tagging you in photos that the Facebook machine learning algorithm can use to detect faces on a photo or in the future a self-driving car can take you to places with your family or friends which uses a machine-learning algorithm. Your job or family member's jobs might be affected as well by machine learning advancement and you might need to learn and move into industries related to machine learning or computing.</p>
