        <h2>Machnine learning By Ahnaf Zaman</h2>
        <p>Machine learning Is seen as a branch of artificial intelligence and works by learning from experience without
            being programmed to do so using various algorithms. Currently the state of the art in machine learning is
            according to medium, transfer learning which allows algorithms used for a task, be used for a different task
            such as an algorithm used for identifying the colour yellow now used to look for yellows cars. Another
            state-of-the-art technology used for machine learning is a voice user interface, which is by personal
            assistants such as Siri Alexa and works by “deep learning algorithms” like speech recognition and language
            modelling. Another technology used by machine learning is “artificial neural networks”. Neural networks
            attempt to simulate how the human brain functions by having an input layer, hidden layer and an output layer
            where it is connected by edges and is used for many purposes such as sakes forecasting to more morally grey
            areas such as deep fakes which the likeness of someone is replaced by another. Currently with machine
            learning a lot can be done and the more positives things are as mentioned are voice assistants which are
            improving daily as the algorithm learns how to interacts with a human and allows user to set up times,
            search up information or play music and much more using voice, and googles new project duplex highlights how
            advanced this technology can be as the app allows the assistant to make a reservation in shops with the
            voice assistant without needing to do a lot of interacting with the phone operator at all, with the
            assistant using a natural sounding voice. Another use of machine learning that may be controversial to a lot
            is mass surveillance and detection. Using facial recognition algorithms, it can detect faces and identify a
            person for various things, most common is criminals and the algorithm has a low error rate which is becoming
            lower each year as governments and companies utilizes it more and more. The technology is notoriously used
            in “personalization” for marketing which uses the system to flood users with ads relating to something the
            user saw online and shows up across various websites with ads that a user might go to. Relating to
            personalisation various sites also use to cater to a user’s taste such as Netflix which might give a user
            similar results to a movie or tv show that they watched appearing in a recommended tab. In the future
            machine learning algorithms will become much more advanced allowing more innovations such as applications in
            voice assistant as the assistant will be able to understand more speech patterns and have a wider range of
            applications a user can talk about.
            The neural network will also allow things such as pattern recognition get more accurate as it gets more
            utilized allowing computers to do things like creating an image from just a suggestion from the user and
            will also let companies can use it for more accurate targeted ads or making games run much smoother such as
            NVidia DLSS using A.I to upscale things and the technology will be much more utilized and more accurate in
            the next 3 years. This is possible due to technology becoming much more powerful such as the CPU getting
            more cores and semiconductor manufacturing becoming more efficient and smaller allowing machine learning to
            do repetitions. And advancements in network technology such as 4g and 5g allows machine learning to help
            self-driving cars drive more accurately track its location and send data back to the company faster and
            track the location of the care more accurately. In the future quantum computing is said to accelerate the
            process of machine learning and greatly improve other areas it is used in such as realistic A.I. The impact
            of machine learning is great as it is being currently used everywhere on the internet and in many industries
            such as healthcare, finance, and the government. Things that are likely to change are the automation
            industry which will employ self-driving cars in the future that will allow customers to travel from one
            location to another or customer service with companies using more digital assistants to interact with users
            than humans. Education could also change such as virtual tutors helping children with tasks reducing
            workloads on teachers. According to Forbes the Global market could grow to an estimated $126 billion in
            2024. The top industry for machine learning is chatbots followed by process optimization than fraud
            analysis. For machine learning there are currently over 98000 open positions for machine learning worldwide.
            The people that are most likely to be affected is everyone, as it will be utilized in more and more
            applications as machine learning is flexible and makes many industries that require repetition suitable for
            machine learning, and is also used in social media for facial recognition and search engine optimization,
            and will be used for self-driving cars in the future that the general population would use. As machine
            learning becomes more advanced a lot of jobs might be lost such as taxi driving and a lot of retail jobs and
            according to Forbes it could make take away an estimated 75 million jobs worldwide but Forbes while fortune
            state that 40% of the world jobs will be lost with truck drivers and retail being most affected. It is also
            reported by Forbes that A.I and machine
            learning will create more jobs with a potential of 133 million new jobs worldwide by 2022. This is affecting
            you right now in your daily life as almost every major site uses some form of the machine learning
            algorithm, such as YouTube when watching a video will cater to your taste depending on what type of video
            you watch,
            and many sites will personalize ads tailored to you. If you use a voice assistant, it is getting millions of
            inputs that it's using to give a more accurate response to make the experience more lifelike and if you play
            video games, machine learning is being utilized to upscale the resolution of games and make the A.i of the
            game much smarter and more lifelike. Machine learning applications
            can be different for each user if they choose to use more applications that utilize machine learning such as
            a personal assistant or extensive use of social media which will use machine learning to tailor to you such
            as giving you ads that might be different or Netflix giving you a unique selection of shows based on what
            you just watched. This will affect the people around you as well such as tagging you in photos that the
            Facebook machine learning algorithm can use to detect faces on a photo or in the future a self-driving car
            can take you to places with your family or friends which uses a machine-learning algorithm. Your job or
            family member's jobs might be affected as well by machine learning advancement and you might need to learn
            and move into industries related to machine learning or computing.</p>

        <h2>Augmented Reality by Joshua Kreppold</h2>
        <p>hello</p>

        <h2>Cybersecuirty by Julian Chessari</h2>
        <p>Cyber security involves protecting online data from being compromised from intruders to the system as well as
            being prepared to detect, analyze, track and mitigate any external threats that may try to harm the
            integrity of the data. One of cyber security's goal is to defend computers, servers and networks from
            malicious attacks. Cyber Security involves installing firewalls the protect the network from blatant and
            simple attacks, monitoring suspicious activity to see if somebody is trying to break in, creating security
            plans and protocols for when the network is under attack and data is being stolen which in turn is trying
            to lock out anyone that has gotten into the network successfully and finding vulnerabilities in the network,
            software or hardware and fixing them before they can be exploited by external threats. The cyber security
            industry is constantly evolving with new technologies. Behavior analytics are currently one of the best
            measures of cyber security. Behavior analytics involves revealing the actions that users take within a
            digital or online product. One example of this is bioprinting which could be monitoring how fast somebody
            types or how they operate a computer mouse. Companies are now creating behavioral profiles of users,
            accounts and devices and they now monitor how their behavior changes overtime.
            Measuring and monitoring users behaviors allows companies to see if there are drastic and erratic changes in
            behavior, if so then the company may want to monitor that person as they could be a possible security threat
            and may be attempting to breach the network. A cyber threat is an attack which steals or harms digital data
            which are currently more common than ever considering the constantly evolving digital world we live in
            today. However cyber security tries to combat cyber threats in many ways now. For businesses one a way they
            can build a defense is by patching their system when a security flaw is found in their system. This prevents
            hackers from exploiting the flaw in their code or prevents further damage from occurring in the network.
            Another measure that is taken that can be done now is attack simulations. This is where people employed by
            the business try to break into their network which reveals holes in their network which should be fixed
            before an external threats exploits it. This allows the business to be ahead of cyber threats. Individuals
            can take cyber defense measure for themselves to protect themselves from cyber threats such as creating long
            passwords with upper and lower case letters, numbers and characters, this makes it difficult for hackers to
            crack your password. Another measure that can be taken by individuals is being cautious against phishing
            attacks which is when an email or link looks legit and safe but when you click on the email attachment or
            link it installs malware or gains access to your system and network.
            As cyber attacks become more advanced, trying to detect breaches without the use of artificial intelligence
            becomes significantly difficult. The future of cyber security is going to be the development artificial
            intelligence. "69% of enterprises believe artificial intelligence will be necessary to respond to cyber
            attacks". A majority of telecommunication companies, consumers product companies and banks are relying on
            the improving development of artificial intelligence to help detect and combat cyber attacks against them.
            Because of these breaches over $50 million has been lost in the telecommunication industry because of these
            breaches. In light of this, executives are putting their time and budget into developing artificial
            intelligence to detect cyber threats rather than predicting and responding to them.
            "64% say that AI lowers the cost to detect and respond to breaches and reduces the overall time taken to
            detect threats and breaches". A threat actor or malicious actor is an individual or organization that is
            responsible for an event or incident that
            impacts the safety or protection of another organization or has the potential to impact it. Artificial
            intelligence helps reduce the amount of time a threat actor is undetected by 11%. Artificial intelligence
            helps reduce time it takes for detection "by continuously scanning for known or unknown anomalies that show
            threat patterns" which helps remove cyber threats which helps save the company money. The improvement and
            implementation of artificial intelligence in cyber security is slow as it while take a while to code and
            develop as well as the AI to learn.A potential impact in the development of artificial intelligence on the
            cyber security industry would be the revision of how people login and their details. This would lead to
            biometrics being used for login which creates an increase in security over standard written passwords which
            are much more vulnerable to being cracked and being victim to cyber attacks.
            Instead people will use their fingerprint, palm print or retina scans. This is already in use in individuals
            phones which is becoming the norm, soon it may lead to peoples laptops, home security and other logins
            involved in the company work. The way detecting threats and other malicious software or activities is
            currently handled may change due to the advancement of artificial intelligence in the cyber security
            industry. This is because the current conventional systems are unable to understand the current malware and
            different threats that is constantly being created. Developers of cyber security software train artificial
            intelligence to detect malware and malware before it enters the network, this prevents damage from occurring
            to the system and is much faster than the conventional systems. People that may be affected by this are
            cyber security employees that may need to learn new ways of dealing with cyber attacks and how to use new
            artificial intelligence that tackle the external threats.
            This new and improving constant development of artificial intelligence for the purpose of cyber security
            will create jobs in the industry. There is already a shortage in the industry and ever developing artificial
            intelligence will create more. As cyber attacks become more advanced and increase every year the need for
            cyber security jobs will expand along with it as from 2012 to 2022 the rate of job growth in digital
            security jobs is expected to be 37% which is a lot higher than other industries. However as AI is on the
            rise, if some cyber security specialists do not understand or learn AI in the spectrum of cyber security
            then they may be pushed out of their jobs and deemed redundant as their method of security would be inferior
            to the new comers who have learned AI which is the future in the defense against cyber attacks.As cyber
            threats increase every year, the need and demand for cyber security specialists (jobs) increase with it. Not
            only do cyber terrorists attack large businesses and companies but they also attack individuals, so nobody
            is safe. Cyber threats can cause numerous events to happen such as electrical blackouts, theft of personal
            sensitive data, disrupt networks etc. There is more than one way a cyber threat can disrupt digital
            information such as malware which corrupts data or takes over a system on a device or network, or spear
            phishing which involves the attackers impersonating someone that the victim of the attack knows and trusts
            and then sends a malicious file to them which installs malware on their computer when opened or it could be
            ransomware which involves holding data, a network or a system hostage from the victim unless them pay them
            money in exchange for them to gain back access.
            In order for people to avoid and protect themselves from there cyber threats there are precautions they can
            take such as creating long passwords involving lower and upper case letters, symbols and numbers. They could
            also install anti-virus software which scans your computer for malicious files and makes sure the files you
            download are malware free. Also being aware of phishing scams is a good precaution as you know what to look
            at out for which means you will not just believe everything you see. In light of how easy it is to be
            personally attacked digitally, enterprises have stepped up their resources for developing artificial
            intelligence in the cyber security industry to help individuals and companies from being digitally attacked.
            In particular the use of biometric login by using fingerprint, retina and palm print in conjunction or
            replacing standard character passwords making it a lot harder for password crackers and cyber threats to
            happen against you and everyone else. In addition artificial intelligence algorithms being developed which
            means it teaches the AI to detect ransomware and malware attacks before it enters the system and removing it
            which keeps people safe so there would be more software available to consumers to protect their devices.
            In addition companies are adding two factor authentication to their services which may mean that logging in
            has additional information required to be entered such as a code sent to your phone number or an app on your
            phone that produces a code as well as adding in your password. This helps prevent unauthorized access into
            your accounts if your password has been stolen. Also it can help locate where the login is coming from, for
            example if you normally login from Melbourne and then all of a sudden a login comes from Russia a two factor
            authentication may be required to confirm it is you and not someone else with your stolen password.</p>

        <h2>Internet of Things(I0t) By James Henderson</h2>
        <p>The term Internet of Things is used to describe a network of physical appliances that are able to transfer information with each other without human interaction. This transfer is usually done through cloud or LAN based network in which internet connected devices such as smart fridges or lights can remotely send each other relevant information. Most IoT devices collect this information through the use of sensors built into the device. These sensors usually detect the Off/On state of the device and record all usage data. From this information IoT devices are able to develop user profiles and record patterns in

            behaviour to better customise and adapt itself to the users needs. As of 2020 we are surrounded by “smart” (IoT) devices with most serving a primary goal of user convenience and data collection.
            
            The current IoT industry is developing at a rapid pace, and with new and improved technologies being released every month it's almost hard to keep up. 
            Companies such as Philips have made waves in the IoT industry with innovations such as their smart “Philips Hue” lighting range which allows any home to have (semi)
             affordable smart lighting through the use of a central LAN hub and internet connected light bulbs. This technology paired with the ability to use voice assistants such as
              Google Assistant, Alexa or Siri for hands free control has only had further impact on it’s popularity due to its widespread compatibility and ease of use. The ability to 
              interconnect many different brands of smart home products through a central digital assistant has also given users the freedom of choice between brands as well as encouraging competition due
               to the inability to lock in customers to your software. In the next three year I believe IoT products will continue to expand to larger audiences to which having “smart” devices is no longer an upper class luxury but rather a norm for all modern homes. Although this is what I foresee in the near future I am also aware of the growing privacy concerns and security risks that may come with the use of these products. Giving a company access to data such as your lighting behaviour or what meals you cook for dinner is quite a scary thought as it adds another personal level to a users already existing data file, which can be used to advertise and target content at specific user groups.
                If companies are breached this could potentially give a hacker valuable information such as when users go to sleep or leave the house, allowing large groups of people to be susceptible to various behaviours. Another large security concern is the accessing of internet connected cameras and microphones for intel gathering or blackmail. By voluntarily putting listening devices in our homes in the form of IoT devices,
             we are not only at risk of compromising our security but rather practically giving it away.This rapid development of IoT devices has both a likely positive and negative impact towards society. Due to things such as remote access and auto timeout and location based settings on most IoT devices, I believe one of the biggest benefits to come out of this technology would be the ability to have a smart network efficiently save electricity for you by automatically turning on and off certain appliances that aren’t in use. This coupled with the fact that most smart products today have a higher energy efficiency rating than their ‘dumb’ counterparts could have us see a future in which the carbon footprints
              of 1st world countries decrease dramatically.I believe that as IoT devices become the norm, the automation of daily human life will increase significantly. Daily tasks that I would have once performed would be able to be set through apps and programming rules, essentially removing a lot of the “work” out of basic survival. Personally when I think of myself in this IoT future my mind immediately gravitates to the Pixar dystopian world of the film WALL-E in which humans are so reliant on technology to do everything for them that they lose the ability to perform everyday tasks. Although I do not believe that a rapid growth in IoT devices will lead to a future that is distorted by this technology, it 
              does make me question as to why simple activities such as making a coffee or turning on the lights have the need to be automated in the first place. Another potential direct effect of the increase in IoT device popularity would be the increase in availability of my personal information that large corporations have access to. I find this to be particularly frightening as I value my online security quite heavily and would not feel comfortable 
              being constantly analysed by every appliance in my house for the purpose of monetary gain.</p>
