        <h2>Julian</h2>
        <p>
            One thing that went well was our communication was really good throughout the assignment period. We were
            always talking on our group chat discussing work and figuring what our next step would be. We also had at
            least one meeting per week on Microsoft teams which helped us verbally discuss ideas and hoe everyone was
            going with their assigned work. One thing that could be improved could be our time management. Sometimes I
            was late to a meeting or didn't have my work done on time when someone else needed it, could have been a bit
            more productive and less lazy however all the work got done in the end without any problems. One thing that
            was surprising was our ability to get all our work done and communicate while we are in lockdown. It would
            have been much easier if we could meet up and show our work to each other in person as well as helping each
            other but we all pulled through and got our work done. One thing I learned about groups is that it is a lot
            easier to do work in a group because with regular meetings you can get a lot of work done, you can also help
            each our with things you done understand , bounce ideas of each other and it lightens the work load all
            round.
        </p>
        <h2>James</h2>
        <p>
            The constant group meetings throughout the process of the assignment really made communication between the
            group both clear and effective. This greatly helped in keeping everyone on top of their various assigned
            tasks as we would set each other due dates and uphold certain expectations of each of our members. This
            setup also allowed for some independence within our group as we would be able to do our tasks on our own
            first and then regroup and discuss feedback and if it was representative of the collective team idea.
            Although we were quite on top of tasks with group meetings and conversations, I believe that we may have
            overestimated the time needed for certain tasks and may have been a bit too lenient with group due dates as
            a result. For next time I think something like a Gantt chart may need to be implemented at the start of the
            project for a more concise and accurate timeline of what needs to be done and when. One thing that surprised
            me regarding this assignment was the great organizational skills shown by our team in regards to our regular
            meetings and delegation of tasks. I was quite happy with how we effectively used each person's skills to the
            group advantage such as Nathan and his knowledge in CSS and Ahnaf and his great leadership ability in being
            able to actively stay on top of task checklists. This overall was a pleasant surprise as I feel like our
            group worked quite autonomously with very few issues as a result of this. I have learned through this
            assignment that with effective leadership and clear communication, group tasks can be managed in an
            effective and productive manner.
        </p>
        <h2>Ahnaf</h2>
        <p>
            What went well for the group is that we were able to set up a meeting consistently on time every week, as
            well as setting up a git hub and utilizing it with minimal conflict. We were also able to finish a lot of
            tasks needed on time such as setting up an HTML page and make a navbar that works. Improvement in a lot of
            areas can be made as well such as our communication such as every member participating in chat as some were
            more talkative than others. Our time management skills for submitting parts of the project can be improved
            as not everyone in the group was able to complete a certain task in time. Something surprising is our
            interest for I.T and how we were able to discuss various topics about I.T which translated into a lot of
            ideas making it into our assignments such as the design and the topics discussed as well as many of the
            team's members knowledge of HTML and CSS while not vas it is competent. I have learned that time management
            is important in a group as it will help the group become consistent and make working on projects much
            easier. I also learned that the group cannot perform as well if everyone is not putting all their effort
            into it which can drag the group down.
        </p>
        <h2>Nathan</h2>
        <p>
            The group performed really well in regards to having consistent and efficient meetings and completing our
            assigned work in a timely and efficient manner, we also had efficient use of teams with using shared word
            documents to assign tasks and monitor the progress of the project in an overall sense. I think we could
            improve our time management at the start of the assignment as it took us a longer than expected time to
            start the small tasks, although we did increase our work output as a whole later in the assignment. One
            thing that surprised me was the amount of communication we were able to facilitate even due to the current
            COVID-19 pandemic. One thing I have learnt about groups is the importance of good communication and set
            roles within a group. E.g. a meeting leader and Technical lead, as this greatly improves the time use both
            during meetings and out of meetings as work is not unnecessarily repeated.
        </p>
        <h2>Josh</h2>
        <p>
            Most aspects of our assignment flowed without a hitch. We keep each other updated by having at least one
            meeting per week throughout our time working on the assignment. This helped us keep on top of our work and
            we were able to allocate tasks between ourselves smoothly. On a personal level I believe my time management
            and concentration could have been improved. Although I had no problem completing my own allocated work, I
            still found that I was rushing to get work done because I had been focusing on different work before that.
            Because of that I hope to start the next assignment earlier than this one to be more prepared. It surprised
            me that although the COVID-19 lockdown laws are in effect it had little hassle towards our assignment.
            Everyone contributed to the assignment and as a group I felt we worked quite decently even though it was
            completely online. I learned that working in groups is an effective way to reach a goal if everyone puts in;
            each member needs to do their part for a successful group.

        <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
        <p>
            Our group came to a consensus that communication between group members was pretty clear, however our time
            management could have been improved significantly. We found that dates for tasks to be completed kept
            getting pushed back due to other assignments and external factors, which ended up leaving sections to still
            be completed quite close to the due date. This proved to decrease motivation within the group as we ended up
            having to do large chunks of work at a time to meet our deadlines rather than having it all properly spaced
            out. Each of our group members were quite satisfied with the quality of work submitted and it was evident
            that everyone had put thorough effort into their respective sections. We were all especially pleased with
            the backbone HTML and CSS being completed quite early as it allowed for group members to solely focus on
            their research paragraphs without needing to worry about how to implement it into the website. One thing
            that the group agreed that we might have been able to improve on was the creativity in our CSS design. We
            decided to go with quite a practical and simplistic layout however, the inclusion of colours and more images
            may have benefited the user experience of the website as a whole. One thing that surprised our group was the
            realization of just how much planning can make a difference in the final result. When we first started the
            assignment we did not really have a solid plan of how the website was going to look or use any mockups to
            demonstrate our ideas, this was reflected in the final product as we decided to eventually play it safe and
            used the simplistic design as seen in our final product. This will definitely be reflected in our next
            assignment as we have learned the great importance of solid planning during the first stages of our project.
            One other thing that we will also implement in the commencement of our next assignment is the further use of
            Git as a team. During this assignment, we primarily used shared word documents rather than each person
            pushing their own Git changes due to convenience purposes, however next time we feel that everyone should
            contribute equally to our Git as well to better even the workload on everyone and better develop essential
            skills.
